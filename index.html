      <p>
        A flower is the reproductive part of flowering plants. Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of
        a plant. Flowers have petals. Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce
        pollen and seeds.In all plants, a flower is usually its most colourful part. We say the plant 'flowers',
        'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out. There are
        many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world. Even in the coldest places, for example
        the Arctic, flowers can grow during a few months.

            In the list of top 4 flowers, roses have got to be on top for obvious reasons.
            They have such an international appeal to them. So, no doubt that roses are amongst
            the most popular flowers. They are available in different colors. A red rose flower
            is most commonly used to denote love.
            <br>
              <span class="read-more-target">A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa,
              in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens
              of thousands of cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can be erect
              shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[citation
              needed] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours 
              ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller
              numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.[citation needed] Species, 
              cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. 
              have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from 
              compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.[citation 
              needed] Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of
              the wide range of garden roses.</span>

            Tulips are known for their bold colors and beautiful shape,
            and most varieties are indeed almost perfectly symmetrical.
            The blooms have three petals and three sepals, but since the
            sepals are almost the same size and shape as the petals,
            tulips appear to have six petals to a bulb.
            <br>
            <span class="read-more-target">Tulips (Tulipa) are a genus of spring-blooming
            perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes (having bulbs as storage organs).
            The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly coloured, generally red,
            pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colours). They often have a different
            coloured blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals, collectively),
            internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations, and a long history
            of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member
            of the lily family, Liliaceae, along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely
            related to Amana, Erythronium and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae.</span>

            Sunflower is one of the popular flowers names. It
            symbolizes loyalty as it always keeps its face towards the Sun. If
            someone asks you "what is the most popular flower", we are more than
            sure you wouldn't waste a minute before saying sunflower or roses,
            depending on your mood.
            <br>
          <span class="read-more-target">
          The sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is a living annual plant in the family
          Asteraceae, with a large flower head (capitulum). The stem of the flower
          can grow up to 3 metres tall, with a flower head that can be 30 cm wide. 
          Other types of sunflowers include the California Royal Sunflower, which has a burgundy 
          (red + purple) flower head.
          <br>
          The flower head is actually an inflorescence made of hundreds 
          or thousands of tiny flowers called florets. The central florets 
          look like the centre of a normal flower, apseudanthium. The benefit 
          to the plant is that it is very easily seen by the insects and birds 
          which pollinate it, and it produces thousands of seeds.

            Daisy is easily found around the planet, and people also call it
            the cousin of the sunflower. Their beauty makes them a favorite
            pick as a home garden flower. Daisies make for the most popular
            garden flowers because they are so pleasant to look at.

               hairy leaves near its base that form a rosette. The plant has leafless
               flower stalks and hairy bracts (leaflike structures) below the flower
               heads. Some varieties of the English daisy have double flowers; others may
               have pink or red ray flowers surrounding the bright yellow disk.
